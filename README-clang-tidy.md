# Clang-Tidy Local Development Guide

## Quick Start

Before committing code, run clang-tidy to check for issues:

```bash
# From project root
./scripts/run-clang-tidy.sh
```

## What it does

The script:
1. Uses `compile_commands.json` generated by CMake
2. Runs `clang-tidy-19` on all source files in the compilation database
3. Reports code quality issues, potential bugs, and style violations

## Requirements

- Build directory must exist: `build/`
- `compile_commands.json` must be present (auto-generated by CMake with `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`)

## If build is missing

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Configuration

Edit [.clang-tidy](.clang-tidy) to customize checks. Current configuration:
- Focus on bugs and correctness
- Relaxed naming conventions (project uses mixed styles)
- Warnings don't fail builds (`WarningsAsErrors: ''`)
